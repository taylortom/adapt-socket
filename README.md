## Usage

### Common API

You will find the following functions on both the front-end and back-end socket plugins.

#### `subscribe(callback[_Function_], actions[_String/Array_])`

Adds a listener to the specified action(s). Callback function is called whenever a matching message is received. In the case that actions is undefined, the listener function will receive _all_ socket messages.

**@return** _Number_ the subscriberâ€™s ID.

#### `unsubscribe(id[_Number_], actions[_String/Array_])`

Removes the listener to the specified action(s). If no action is passed, the listener will be unsubscribed from all actions.

**@return** _Boolean_ success.

#### `publish(action[String], data)`

Sends a message via the socket server.


### Front-end

The front-end plugin registers itself to Notify, and thus can be accessed using `Origin.Notify.socket`.

#### `isConnectionOpen()`

**@return** _Boolean_whether the client is connected to the socket server.
